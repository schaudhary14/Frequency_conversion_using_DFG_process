# FREQUENCY CONVERSION
The frequency conversion device is based on the \chi^{(2)} nonlinear process. It emulates the Difference frequency generation (DFG) process, where the pump at frequency \omega_p
and an input signal state at frequency \omega_s is converted to a new output state at frequency \omega_c = \omega_p - omega_s.

The input state is a bipartite system of signal and converted mode |\psi> = |signal>|0>
